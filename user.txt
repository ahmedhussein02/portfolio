Server Not Found.. website not accessible.. probable fix:
You keep your domain at Hostinger, but change its DNS nameservers to Cloudflare.
Then Cloudflare handles all DNS traffic → no more random outages.

Once deployed, future workflow is simple:
Make local changes (HTML, Python routes, CSS).
Test locally:
venv\Scripts\activate
python app.py
npm run dev:css
Commit and push to GitHub:
git add .
git commit -m "Updated about page and styles"
git push
